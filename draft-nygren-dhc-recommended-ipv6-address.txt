            draft-nygren-dhc-recommended-ipv6-address-latest

Abstract

   This document defines a new DHCPv6 option for communicating one or
   more recommended /128 IPv6 address to hosts within an assigned
   prefix.  The Recommended Address option allows DHCPv6 servers to
   suggest specific IPv6 addresses that hosts should additionally use
   when configuring addresses within the assigned prefix.

1.  Introduction

   IA_PD within DHCPv6 [RFC8415] allows clients such as hosts to request
   IPv6 prefixes, typically for delegation to downstream networks or
   interfaces.  In scenarios such as Unique Prefix Per Host [RFC8273]
   the host is given the entire prefix and is free to use addresses from
   it as it sees fit.

   This document defines the Recommended Address option, which can be
   included within OPTION_IAPREFIX options to suggest one or more
   specific IPv6 addresses that clients should configure when using the
   associated prefix.  These do not preclude the client from using other
   addresses within the prefix, such as for temporary addressing.

   This is intended for use in managed environments such as datacenters
   and cloud providers where the operator is configuring a host that
   they wish to manage or direct clients to.  By providing a recommended
   address, the operator can encourage the host to have a particular
   /128 address that can be used for management purposes or as a service
   endpoint.  At the same time, the remainder of the prefix is available
   for the host to use as it sees fit, such as for containers.  For
   example, this allows the customer of a cloud provider to get a full
   /64 for use by a host while also allowing the customer to configure a
   specific /128 within that /64 that they can use for managing the
   host.

   The Recommended Address(es) continue to be for use by the host,
   differentiating this from PD_EXCLUDE specified in [RFC6603].

   The Recommended Address option is only advisory and while clients MAY
   use these /128 addresses they are not required to do so.

2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Recommended Address Option

   The Recommended Address option provides a mechanism for DHCPv6
   servers to suggest one or more specific IPv6 addresses within an
   assigned prefix that host clients should use on their interface.

3.1.  Option Format

   The format of the Recommended Address option is:

    0                   1                   2                   3
    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |      OPTION_RECADDR           |           option-len          |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
   |                                                               |
   |                     recommended-address                       |
   |                                                               |
   |                                                               |
   +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   Where:

   option-code:  OPTION_RECADDR (TBD by IANA)

   option-len:  17 (length of the option data in octets)

   recommended-address:  A 128-bit IPv6 address that the server
      recommends the client use

3.2.  Option Usage

   The Recommended Address option MUST only appear as a sub-option
   within an OPTION_IAPREFIX option.  Multiple Recommended Address
   options MAY be included within a single OPTION_IAPREFIX option to
   suggest that multiple addresses within the prefix should be assigned
   by the host to its interface.

   The recommended-address field MUST contain an IPv6 address that falls
   within the prefix specified by the enclosing OPTION_IAPREFIX option.
   Servers MUST NOT include Recommended Address options with addresses
   outside the associated prefix.

4.  DHCPv6 Server Behavior

   DHCPv6 servers MAY include OPTION_RECADDR within OPTION_IAPREFIX
   options in ADVERTISE, REPLY, and RENEW responses.

   Servers SHOULD validate that any recommended addresses fall within
   the prefix bounds of the enclosing OPTION_IAPREFIX option before
   including them in responses.

   Servers SHOULD avoid providing recommended addresses that would fall
   within those assigned to EUI-64 SLAAC addresses.

   Servers MUST NOT require clients to use recommended addresses,
   although operators of some tightly managed environments may set
   expectations that accepting connections on recommended address is
   required for proper operational function.  Operators MUST NOT assume
   that clients will use only recommended addresses as source addresses
   from within the prefix as clients remain free to use the entire
   delegated prefix for outbound connections.

5.  DHCPv6 Client Behavior

   DHCPv6 clients MAY process Recommended Address options received
   within OPTION_IAPREFIX options.  Clients that do not understand or
   support the Recommended Address option MUST ignore it, as per
   standard DHCPv6 option processing rules.

   Clients configured to accept Recommended Addresses SHOULD configure
   the Recommended Addresses on a local host interface such that local
   services are reachable on that address.

   Prior to using the address, clients MUST validate that recommended
   address(es) fall within the bounds of the associated prefix and any
   outside MUST be ignored.

   Clients MAY also assign SLAAC addresses such as temporary addresses
   within the prefix.  While clients MAY use Recommended Addresses as a
   preferred source address they are not required to do so.

5.1.  Address Lifetime and Removal

   The lifetime of the Recommended Addresses are associated with that of
   the containing OPTION_IAPREFIX and its associated lease.  Clients
   SHOULD set the valid lifetime and preferred lifetime ([RFC4862]) for
   Recommended Addresses to the remaining lifetime of the DHCPv6 lease
   associated with the OPTION_IAPREFIX.

   If a client had previously received a Recommended Address for a
   prefix but a subsequent advertisement for the same OPTION_IAPREFIX no
   longer contains it, the client SHOULD deprecate the address from its
   interface, such as by setting the preferred-lifetime of the address
   to 0 but leave the valid-lifetime as the remaining lifetime of the
   associated DHCPv6 lease.

6.  Relationship to Prefix Exclude Option

   Unlike [RFC6603] which specifies a sub-prefix to exclude from the
   delegated prefix, Recommended Addresses propose one or more
   recommended addresses that the host client should use.  Servers MUST
   NOT suggest a recommended address within a OPTION_PD_EXCLUDE prefix.

   To be removed prior to publication: An alternate proposal was to use
   IA_NA within an excluded prefix, but that was thought to be too
   messy.

7.  Use-Cases and Suitability

   Cases where an operator may choose to deploy as an alternative to
   using IA_NA:

   *  Client hosts only support IA_PD and not IA_NA but the operator
      wishes to continue to have at least one known /128 address on the
      host.

   *  Client hosts that support IA_PD (such as IPv6 CE routers) and
      which also need an address on which they can be managed.

   The alternatives for having both a IA_PD /64 and an IA_NA /128 for a
   client host is to use either a larger /63 prefix (with half of it
   only being used sparsely for the /128) or to allocate the /64 and
   /128 from disjoint space.  This latter scenario increases FIB count.
   Both of these alternatives require clients to support both IA_PD and
   IA_NA.

8.  Security Considerations

   The Recommended Address option is subject to the same authentication
   and security mechanisms as the base DHCPv6 protocol.  Deployments
   requiring authentication SHOULD use DHCPv6 authentication mechanisms
   [RFC3315] or secure the DHCPv6 communication channel.

   Recommended Addresses may have less entropy (or otherwise be more
   predictable) than those assigned via other mechanisms such as
   [RFC4941] and as such may be easier for attackers to find while
   scanning IPv6 address space.

9.  Privacy Considerations

   Recommended Addresses are primarily intended for use in managed
   environments such as data centers and cloud providers.

   This option extends upon DHCPv6 so has similar privacy properties to
   other modes of DHCPv6 such as IA_NA.  See [RFC7824] for an extensive
   discussion of these properties.  As Recommended Addresses are under
   server control and may have less entropy, they may be more
   predictable within the /64 than addresses under the clients control
   to select.  Clients configured to use [RFC4941] Privacy Addresses or
   similar scheme may chose to prefer those as a default source address.

10.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests IANA to assign a new DHCPv6 option code for
   the Recommended Address option from the "Dynamic Host Configuration
   Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)" registry.

   Thank you to Lorenzo Colitti, Kasper Dupont, and others for their
   feedback and suggestions on this document.

Appendix B.  Open Questions

   NOTE TO RFC EDITOR: to be removed before publication.

   Some open questions for discussions include:

   *  Should we allow prefixes in-addition to /128 along with labels for
      those prefixes?  For example to signal things like which ranges
      should be sub-delegated for use by Docker, etc?

   *  What name should we use for this option?  OPTION_RECADDR?
      OPTION_RECOMMENDED_ADDRESS?

   *  When should we use "client" vs "host"?

   *  Do we need more description of use-cases and purpose?

Appendix C.  Change History

   NOTE TO RFC EDITOR: to be removed before publication.

C.1.  Changes in -01

   *  Clarify handling of removal, as well as provide recommendations
      for address lifetime.

   *  Add use-cases and suitability.  Increase clarity on the use-cases
      for hosts as well as the alternative.

C.2.  Prior to -00

   *  Removed priority and made it very clear that this is in-addition
      to temporary addresses and does not require clients to use these
      as a source address.
